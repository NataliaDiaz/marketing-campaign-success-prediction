Feature engineering and analysis for marketing campaign success prediction with regression models



# Feature Engineering, Descriptive Statistics and Correlation Analysis

The data shows features around advertising campaigns for digital products. This projects performs feature engineering previous to a regression model for the prediction of the performance of these campaigns having into account only that:
All columns are features, and the outcome variable Y is column nr. 3

- We describe Y (column 3) in terms of the count, standard deviation, mean and median values and the general shape and whether we can say it can be considered a normal distribution.

- To find if other columns correlated to each other, or to column 3, we perform correlation analysis.

- I discuss regression models pros and cons

- I discuss how to validate the accuracy and validate the robustness of your model

NOTE: it is a blind dataset, the features' descriptions are unknown.
